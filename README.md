# **Client management with react and hooks**

Our company has created a React app to handle the customers.

Use correct node version: **nvm use**

Install dependencies: **npm install**

Run app: **npm run dev**

**Info:** it's not a problem that customers are lost when website is reloaded because in a future an API will be used to get them.

**Exercise 1.**
In the last push, the imports/exports were broken. If possible, could you fix them by modifying only the imports? Please modify the exports only if it's not possible to fix the issue through the imports.

**Exercise 1.1**
Could you use export default for all React components?

**Exercise 2**
CustomerList.jsx could be refectored using an array method directly in the return. Could you give it a try?
